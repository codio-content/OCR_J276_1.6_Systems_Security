Websites, for example social networking sites and online banking sites, use databases to store usersâ€™ details. 

In order to query these databases, for example when a user logs in, and search for information, structured query language or SQL may have to be used (this is covered in section 2.2 of the specification). 

When a user enters their username and password, SQL is used to check if these are correct and stored in the database.

Criminals can input specially created commands instead of a username or password. These commands can bypass the login requirements and gain access to the database so that the criminals have access to the data, for example names, addresses and credit card details.

Organisations must carefully check the SQL commands entered to filter out these dangerous commands. This is called input sanitisation.
