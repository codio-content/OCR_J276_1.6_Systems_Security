Human error is the root cause of 52 per cent of all security breaches to networks because people fail to follow correct  procedures, are careless and lack any knowledge of the threats.

Social engineering means psychologically tricking people into divulging their secret information or doing things that they would not otherwise do.
Examples of social engineering attacks include:

### Blagging
This can be done face-to-face, by telephone or by computer. The criminal invents a scenario to try to get the victim to divulge information, for example pretending to be a bank employee to get people to divulge account information such as passwords, account information and PINs.

### Phishing
This is when fraudsters send emails claiming to be from a bank or e-commerce site in order to find out your personal and financial details.
They have false links that the recipient is asked to click on to take them to a website controlled by the criminals.

### Shouldering
This is sometimes referred to as ‘shoulder-surfing’ and it involves finding login names, passwords, credit card and PIN (personal information numbers) details by direct observation.
For example someone in an office watching others entering passwords or watching someone enter their PIN at a cash machine (ATM). Employees at a shop or petrol station can watch a PIN being entered.
To prevent shoulder surfing, the keypad should be shielded from view by using your body
or cupping a hand over the keypad.
