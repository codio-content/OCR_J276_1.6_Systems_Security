Malware is software designed to:

- gain unauthorised access to a computer system
- disrupt the functioning of a computer system
- gather information from the users without their knowledge

Types of malware include:

### Virus
A virus is a computer program that is hidden within another program or file. It can replicate itself and infect other programs or files which are then often passed by a user to other computers. Viruses usually have a harmful effect, for example corrupting or deleting data on a disk.

### Worm 
A worm is different to a virus in that:

- It has an independent existence: it does not have to exist inside another program or file.
- It does not need human action to spread it: it can travel unaided to other computers, for example through a network or by sending itself in emails to everyone in a user’s address book.

As the worm is making thousands of copies of itself it will use the computer’s resources and cause other programs to run slowly. Some worms cause damage by deleting data.

### Trojan
A Trojan does not replicate or attach itself to other files.
It must be installed by a computer user who thinks they are installing legitimate software or by opening an email attachment (that is why they are called Trojan horses).

- Trojans can just be annoying, for example by changing the desktop and adding new icons.
- They can also be malicious, for example by deleting files and destroying system information.
- They can also create ‘back doors’ to computer systems so allowing criminals to access your personal data, for example they can transmit your key presses or screen shots across the Internet to the criminal’s computer.
