Phishing involves criminals spamming as many people as possible inviting them to click on a link to an external website that is fake. The website will be of a famous and reputable business such as a bank. The user will input their personal details such as passwords and these will then be stolen by the criminals. Once the criminals have this information they will be able to login to the real website to steal and transfer funds.
