Unlike the other threats which are external, this is a self-made internal threat. Without definite policies, strictly administered all networks are under threat.
Network policies should cover:

- Passwords â€“ this is covered in the next lesson.
- The use of removable media - such as USB flash drives, smartphones, CDs, DVDs, MP3 players and even digital cameras.
These devices pose a threat as malware can be introduced to the network and data can be removed and stolen.
Even if data is removed for work reasons, the company may be sued if this data is covered by the Data Protection Act and there is the risk of the devices being lost or stolen.
The policy will probably state that the connection of such devices is prohibited unless the user has made a request for their use. 
- Backup policy - this is about the copying of programs and data stored on the network to safeguard them in case the security of the network is compromised.
it should include such items as when backups will be made, the person responsible and where they will be stored.
- Disaster recovery policy - this disaster is a set of procedures that the organisation will follow to restore normal network operations after it has been compromised.
