This type of attack is designed to make a network or website grind to a halt by flooding it with useless network communications such as repeated login requests. 
The criminals may use malware to take control of lots of computers (‘zombies’), by infecting them with Trojans, that all send login and information requests at the same time.

- The criminals may use these attacks to extort money from the company to stop the attacks. 
- They may offer their services to a rival company to ‘take out’ the competition. 
- They may be used by activists (known as ‘hacktivists’) to punish a company that they deem to be unethical.
