## People as the ‘weak point’ in secure systems (social engineering)

Social engineering is a term used to describe the process of tricking people into disclosing sensitive information about a company. This information could be trading secrets or login details. 
One of the most common threats to an organisation is in fact the people that work there. This could be anyone from a network manager setting the network up insecurely or an employee not following procedures. That is why it is often said that ‘people are the weak point in a system’. A network policy is a set of rules and procedures that an organisation must follow in order to keep the network secure. It is the ‘people’ who devise and follow these procedures, therefore they will be considered the weak point if the policies are ineffective.
