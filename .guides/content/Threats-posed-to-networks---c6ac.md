### Malware 

**Mal**icious Soft**ware**

Malware is malicious software that has been downloaded and installed without the userâ€™s knowledge. There are several different types of malware that can cause different types of damage.

Adware: Displays adverts on your screen that take over the control of your operating system.

Spyware: As the name suggests this piece of software will spy and monitor your internet activity to build a picture of likes and interests. Specific adverts via adware could then be used to target the individual.

Virus: A virus is malicious code that is spread between devices by attaching themselves to files. Once these files are then opened on the other device they are then activated and can cause harm.

Worm: A worm replicates itself and aims to destroy the files on a device and the operating system itself. Worms can be very malicious and will not stop until all of the files have been deleted or destroyed.

Trojan: Disguise themselves as legitimate software that the user will download and install them not knowing that they have a malicious purpose.
