## Forms of attack 

A smooth running network can be crucial for a business as downtime or loss of data will impact on their reputation. There are several forms of attack that hackers will use to gain access or try to bring down a network.

### Passive attack

This method involves hackers watching and detecting all of the packets that enter a network. It is difficult to know when the hacker is intercepting data as they quietly monitor the network. When a packet of data containing sensitive information is detected it will be then be used by the hacker. By using encryption it will make it difficult for the hacker to decipher any packets that are stolen. 

### Active attack

An active attack can be easily detected as the hacker will normally be using aggressive methods such as malware and several other viruses. Firewalls and up to date anti-virus software can help prevent against this type of threat.

### Insider attack

When an individual who has inside access to the network takes advantage of their privilege, this is known as an insider attack. The individual could access data and divulge it to third parties or use their access to cause harm to the network. Internal procedures such as logging access times can help prevent insiders attacking the network.

### Brute force attack

This form of attack involves using brute force to try and access a network. This is performed by using software that predicts a range of suitable passwords. As many possible combinations of words and letters are used until the correct password is authorised. Strong passwords should be encouraged by the organisation as well as locking the user out of their account if there are too many unsuccessful attempts.

### Denial-of-service attack

DOS attacks prevent the user from using a website or network. Useless packets of data are sent around the network to slow down the traffic of other users. If enough packets flood the network then it could eventually shut down the network. Because the packets that are flooding the network are actually valid packets the firewall usually lets them through. However Firewalls can be configured to block IP addresses that are sending vast amounts of packets.
